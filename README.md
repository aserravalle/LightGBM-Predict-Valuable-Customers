# LightGBM-Predict-Valuable-Customers
Assisted a Portuguese bank to design a telemarketing campaign for selling bank long-term deposits. The client asked our consulting firm to  predict the success of telemarketing calls and helps establish a target customer profile for future marketing plans. 

The main tasks were to clean data, develop a model, and make recommendations. In particular, out of 1408 clients in the Marketing_Eval.csv evaluation dataset, we identified 500 clients which we believe are the ones for which the campaign is most likely to be successful. The client also wanted a non-technical description of:

1. The characteristics of the clients that are more likely to buy long-term deposits and 
2. The economic environment under which the marketing campaign is more likely to be successful

# Model
All the work is done in the Model.ipynb file, simply change the paths and run. The only exception being the R code used to do KNN imputation of missing values. Run the R script seperately and save the files
